# Abstract

This tutorial was written using the following resources. 

  - Books: [@Gandrud2015; @Xie2015]
  - Websites: [@PandocUserGuide; @RMarkdown]
  
Use minus sign before the *\@* to remove the author from the citation. For instance the authors used Gandrud's [-@Gandrud2015] book as a reference to write this manuscript.


# Introduction

Leave a blank line to start a new paragraph. 

*You can italicize text this way.* **You can bold text this way** 

Use \\ as escape character. An escape character is placed in front of characters that have a different meaning for the programming language. For instance, \\ would be used here in front of \\, \*, \%.

# Material and Methods

This is how you insert a figure. 

![Sample Figure (This is a Caption)](Sample_Figure.png)

This is how you include a table into your manuscript.

# Results and Discussion

```{r include = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 

# import required libraries
require(TampaWorkshop)  # contains the data we will be working with.
require(ggplot2) # for plotting
require(plyr)

# import data from TampaWorkshop package
data(corn.yield)

# take a look at the data prior to computing data analysis
summary(corn.yield)

# Convert yield data using the YieldConvertion function and add results as a new column within dataset.
corn.yield <- within(corn.yield, yield.converted <- YieldConversion(yield))

# Summarize converted yield data
summary(corn.yield$yield.converted)

# Compute Analysis of Variance using Linear Model
model <- lm(yield.converted ~ field*cultivar*fertilizer, data=corn.yield)
summary(model)

# Remove non-signficant three-way interaction effect
model2 <- update(model, .~ . -field:cultivar:fertilizer)
anova(model, model2) # P > 0.10, model2 is better
summary(model2)

# Remove first non-signficant two-way interaction effect
model3 <- update(model2, .~ . -cultivar:fertilizer)
anova(model2, model3) # P > 0.10, model3 is better
summary(model3)

# Remove second non-signficant two-way interaction effect
model4 <- update(model3, .~ . -field:fertilizer)
anova(model4, model3) # P > 0.10, model4 is better
summary(model4)

# all remaining effects are significant. 
#We cannot further simplify the model.

# extract model p-value
summary.stat <- summary(model4)$fstatistic
model.pvalue <- pf(summary.stat[1],summary.stat[2],summary.stat[3],lower.tail=F)

```

Linear model p-value was $`r model.pvalue`$.

```{r echo=FALSE}

# compute average values and standard error by treatment
corn.yield.summary <- ddply(corn.yield, .(year,cultivar, fertilizer), function(x){
  mean <- round(mean(x$yield.converted), digits=2)
  sd <- round(sd(x$yield.converted), digits=1)
  count <- NROW(x$yield.converted)
  se <-round(sd/sqrt(count), digits=1)
  
  data.frame(mean=mean, se=se)
})

ggplot(data=corn.yield.summary, aes(x=fertilizer, y=mean, shape=cultivar))+
  geom_point(size=2)  + scale_shape_manual(values=c(1,16), name="Cultivar")+
  xlab("Fertilizer") + ylab("Grain Yield [tons/ha]")+
  ggtitle("Grain Yield Response to Fertilizer and Cultivar")+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), width=0.25)+
  facet_grid(.~year)
```




# Conclusions

This is how you create a non-ordered list in markdown.

  * first item in first order list.
    + First item in second order list below the first item.
    + Second item in second order list below the first item.
  * second item in first order list. 
  
This is how you create an ordered list in markdown.

  1. first item in first order list.
    a. First item in second order list below the first item.
    b. Second item in second order list below the first item.
  2. second item in first order list. 

Make sure that:

  * You have an empty line between the text and your list.
  * First order lists are idented with 1 tab or 4 spaces.
    + Second order lists are indented with 2 tabs ... 
    + ... or 8 spaces.
